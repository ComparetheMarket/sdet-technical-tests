# Comparethemarket technical test - SDET

Thank you for taking the time to do the CTM SDET test. When assessing your test, we will take the following things into account:

* Design of your framework
* Code quality
* Code clarity
* Wording of your tests
* How easily we can run the tests
* Documentation

If you are invited for an interview, you might be required to walk the interviewers through your code, and pair on making some modifications to your framework.

## Instructions

To complete the exercise below, please use this API: <https://github.com/typicode/jsonplaceholder>

As a client of this API, I want to be able to:

* Get a list of the following attributes of an existing user:
  * Name
  * Email
  * Address
  * Phone
  * Website
* Create a new user
* Update user details
* Search for users by email

1. Please write automated tests that cover some of the mentioned functionality. They should serve as an example of the kind of test you would find useful given the above context.
2. If time permits, please add tests for some edge cases or negative scenarios that you can think of.

## Languages

You may use any programming language of your choice. We would prefer that you use a language that will help you show off your skills in building test automation frameworks, rather than one that you are unfamiliar with.

Most of the existing test frameworks at CTM are using Javascript, but we also have some legacy ones written in Ruby and C#.

## Documentation

You should provide instructions on how to run your tests, and note any prerequisites (eg. operating system, language). Include these in a README. If you wish to highlight anything in your tech test, you should do so in the README. The ease with which the interviewers can get your tests running is an important part of the test.

## Submission

Create a public repository on GitHub with your code and send us the link.
