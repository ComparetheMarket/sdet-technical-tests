# CTM SDET test

### Introduction
Thank you for taking the time to do the CTM SDET test.
comparethemarket.com is a price comparison website that you can use to find the best price on a variety of products. Each product has its own user journey. The user journey helps us collate the information required to get quotes from companies that provide the products. 

We would like you to take a look at the energy comparison journey. You can find it here: https://energy.comparethemarket.com/energy/v2/?AFFCLIE=TSTT

Please ensure you use the above URL with the AFFCLIE code so that it doesn't affect the energy team's metrics!

Using a test framework of your choice, in a language of your choice, write at most 3 tests that allows you to explore the functionality. Your tests should only proceed as far as the price results page, for this exercise you don't need to test the 'Switch Now' feature.

You can use the following information to populate the postcode field
  - PE2 6YS

If you have any questions regarding the fields on the energy journey, please raise an issue against this repo, and one of the team will answer your query.

When assessing your test we will take the following things into account:

  - Design of your framework
  - Code quality
  - Code clarity
  - Wording of your tests
  - How easily we can run the tests
  - Documentation 

### Languages
You may use any language of your choice. We would prefer that you use a language that will help you show off your skills in building test automation frameworks, rather than one that you are unfamiliar with.

Most of the existing test frameworks at CTM are using javascript, but we also have some legacy ones written in ruby and C#.

### Documentation
You should provide complete instructions on how to run your tests, and note any pre requisites (eg. operating system, language). Include these in a README. If you wish to highlight anything in your tech test, you should do so in the README.
The ease with which the interviewers can get your tests running is an important part of the test.

### Submission
Create a public repository on github with your code and send us the link. 

### What happens next? 
Our team will review your submission. If your submission meets the needs of our current available positions, you will be invited for a final face-to-face interview. 
At his final stage, the interviewers will have a friendly chat in order to understand how you approached the problem. You will also have the chance to learn a bit more about how we work and how we can help you develop your career.
