# CTM SDET test

### Introduction
Thank you for taking the time to do the CTM SDET test.
comparethemarket.com is a price comparison website that you can use to find the best price on a variety of products. Each product has its own user journey. The user journey helps us collate the information required to get quotes from companies that provide the products. As you can imagine, the user journeys must always be functional and we need to ensure that they are working on every check in of the code.

We would like you to take a look at the energy comparison journey. You can find it here: https://energy.comparethemarket.com/energy/v2/?AFFCLIE=TST

Please ensure you use the above URL with the AFFCLIE code so that it doesn't affect the energy team's metrics!

Using a test framework of your choice, in a language of your choice, write three tests that you think provide the best coverage of the functionality that is possible in 3 tests. Your tests should only proceed as far as the price results page, for this exercise you don't need to test the 'Switch Now' feature.

You can use the following information to populate the postcode field
  - PE2 6YS

If you have any questions regarding the fields on the energy journey, please raise an issue against this repo, and one of the team will answer your query.

When assessing your test we will take the following things into account:

  - Design of your framework
  - Code quality
  - Code clarity
  - Wording of your tests
  - How easily we can run the tests
  - Documentation 

If you are invited for an interview then you will be required to walk the interviewers through your code and you may be required to make some modifications to your framework as part of the interview.

### Languages
You may use any language of your choice. We would prefer that you use a language that will help you show off your skills in building test automation frameworks, rather than one that you are unfamiliar with.

The languages we use at CTM for test automation are ruby, C# and javascript.

### Test frameworks
The two most common styles of test framework that we use are Specification by Example(rspec) and BDD(cucumber). Bonus points if you use these.

### Documentation
You should provide complete instructions on how to run your tests, and note any pre requisites (eg. operating system, language). Include these in a README. If you wish to highlight anything in your tech test, you should do so in the README.
The ease with which the interviewers can get your tests running is an important part of the test.

### Submission
Create a public repository on github with your code and send us the link.
